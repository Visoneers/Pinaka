Run as administrator. If you donâ€™t do this, you will not be able to enable script support).

2. Check the current script execution policy by using the ``` Get-ExecutionPolicy ``` comand copy and 
paste in PowerSell and press Enter on your keyboard. PowerShell will return a value of ``` Restricted ```.

3. To change the script execution policy, use the ``` Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted ``` comand and press 
Enter on your keyboard. 

3. To ensure that the script execution policy has been changed, use the " Get-ExecutionPolicy " comand 
again. PowerShell should return a value of ``` Unrestricted ```.
